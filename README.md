# Remove Tracking Params
It is a simple browser extension that cleans up the clicked link from some tracking URL parameters before even the request leaves your browser.

The URL parameters removed by the add-on are:
<ul>
  <li>starting with <strong>utm_</strong></li>
  <li>starting with <strong>fb_</strong></li>
  <li><strong>yclid</strong></li>
</ul>

There is no configuration.
